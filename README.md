# Image Classification on Tiny ImageNet

## 1. Dataset
### 1. 1 Tiny ImageNet
Tiny ImageNet Challenge is the default course project for Stanford CS231N. It runs similar to the ImageNet challenge (ILSVRC). Tiny ImageNet has __200 classes__. Each class has __500 training images__, __50 validation images__, and __50 test images__. The images are down-sampled to __64 x 64__ pixels.  

Since the test images are not labeled, I use the validation set as test set to evaluate the models.

### 1. 2 Mnist
Mnist is also used here as a way of evaluating and testing models.

## 2. Models
### 2. 1 Multi-Class SVM
